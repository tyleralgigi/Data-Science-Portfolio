# [Project 1 - Traveling Salemen Genetic Algorithm](https://github.com/tyleralgigi/TSG-genetic-algo)
<p>I have developed a genetic algothirm in Python which solves the traveling salesmen problem. This problem is stated as "Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city?".
