# [Project 1 - Traveling Salemen Genetic Algorithm](https://github.com/tyleralgigi/TSG-genetic-algo)
<p>I have developed a genetic algothirm in Python which solves the traveling salesmen problem. This problem is stated as "Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city?". More can be read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem">TSP wiki</a></p>

# [Project 2 - Search Strategies](https://github.com/tyleralgigi/search-algorithms)
<p>This is an assignment from my Artificial Intelligence course I took while at FAU. The search algorithms used in this program include Uniformed searches (BFS, DFS), Heuristic search (A*) and Adversarial search (minimax).<p>
<p>Part 1 of was to find the shortest straight line route from cities of Romania using Uniformed and Heuristic search methods in Python. The end city is always Bucharest but the starting city is input by the users as well as what search to use.<p>
<p>Part 2 of the assignment was to create a Tic Tac Toe game using Python where the user would play an against the computer who was running the minimax algorithm to determine its next move.<p>
